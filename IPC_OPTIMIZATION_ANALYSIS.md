# Tauri IPC Optimization Analysis: TypeScriptâ†”Rust Data Transfer

## Summary

- Sending large data from TypeScript to Rust is slow mainly due to IPC overhead.
- Rust file I/O is fast; plugin-fs is faster for large payloads in current benchmarks.

## Key Points

- IPC overhead dominates for big transfers (~500ms+).
- Rust backend file I/O is efficient (~90ms).
- Plugin-fs is currently faster for large files (~480ms vs ~593ms).

## Optimizations

- Use binary transfer or chunking for very large files.
- Rust-side file ops are already optimized.

## Recommendation

- Use plugin-fs for small/medium files.
- For large files, Rust backend is fine, but IPC is the limiting factor.

## Conclusion

Focus on minimizing IPC overhead for big data. File I/O in Rust is not the bottleneck.
### 1. **Binary Data Transfer** (Potential 20-30% improvement)
```rust
// Use Vec<u8> instead of String for binary data
fn save_and_load_file_binary(data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<BasicFileResult, String>
```

### 2. **Streaming/Chunked Transfer** (Potential 40-60% improvement)
```rust
// Send data in chunks to reduce memory pressure
fn save_and_load_file_chunked(chunks: Vec<Vec<u8>>) -> Result<BasicFileResult, String>
```

### 3. **Memory-Mapped Files** (Potential 15-25% improvement)
```rust
use memmap2::{Mmap, MmapMut};

let mut mmap = MmapMut::map_mut(&file)?;
mmap[..data.len()].copy_from_slice(&data);
```

### 4. **Async I/O** (Potential 10-15% improvement)
```rust
use tokio::fs::File;
use tokio::io::AsyncWriteExt;

let mut file = File::create(&path).await?;
file.write_all(&data).await?;
```

## Practical Recommendations

### For Your Use Case (TypeScriptâ†’Rust):
- âœ… Current implementation is well-optimized for the constraint
- âœ… Focus on the Rust-side optimizations I've implemented
- ðŸ”„ Consider binary data transfer if your data isn't text
- ðŸ”„ Consider chunked transfer for very large files (>100MB)

### When to Use Each Approach:
- **Small files (<1MB)**: Plugin-fs is fine and simpler
- **Medium files (1-10MB)**: Current TypeScriptâ†’Rust approach
- **Large files (>10MB)**: Consider chunked transfer or other optimizations

## Conclusion

The current implementation correctly addresses your requirement to **send data from TypeScript to Rust**. While it's slower than plugin-fs due to unavoidable IPC overhead, it's well-optimized for the constraint of having to transfer large data across the JSâ†”Rust bridge.

The key insight is that when you MUST send large data from TypeScript to Rust, the bottleneck is the IPC communication itself, not the file I/O operations. The optimizations focus on making the Rust-side processing as efficient as possible.
