# Prompts backlog (easiest â†’ hardest)

1. Add time estimates and tracking to tasks (Est / Done / Overtime)
2. Add satisfying checklist subtasks with smooth animations
3. Notes per task with auto-open external links on start
4. Pomodoro timer (configurable work/break) per task
5. Scheduled tasks (one-time/recurring) with due-now queue and alerts
6. Per-user personalization settings (themes, compact mode, animations)
7. Cross-list scheduling and calendar view
